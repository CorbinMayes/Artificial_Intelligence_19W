To test HMM:
	Run HMM_Run.py. The code to run the maze without walls, and both the ones with walls at the moment. You can comment out each section
	if you want to only look at one at a time. 

To test a new Maze:
	Go to Maze_Generator.py and at the bottom is the test code for it. Change the name of the file that is going to be created so it 
	doesn't overwrite the other mazes already there. Then copy the code in HMM_Run.py and in the read_maze function put the name of 
	the new maze file.
